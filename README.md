# trust-17003---IR-hack
This project involves modifying a Trust 17003 webcam to enable infrared (IR) capability by removing the IR filter from the camera sensor. The modification allows the webcam to capture images in the infrared spectrum. Additionally, an ESP8266 microcontroller will be integrated to provide remote control over Wi-Fi.
